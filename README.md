# REST Client

There are many http clients out there. This yet another one.

To me, it's an experiment as to how simple a restful api can be for Java developers.

Internally, it uses Apache http-client.

## Disclaimer

### It's boring

You don't have to think about thrilling details, and don't have to write much code. Boring.

### It's incomplete

It only supports GET requests, yet. Admittedly the most common use-case, but not usable for most real-world applications. And it's yet only synchronous.

### It's slow

I haven't measured performance or memory consumption. That alone suggests it's not fast. It's quite a thin layer, but still a layer: It can't be any faster than the Apache http-client it's based on. And when it comes to big objects and streaming, it's even much slower and consumes much more memory, as the body is always buffered.

### It's unsafe

E.g., most template replacements are done without proper escaping. This can be a security problem in some cases.

### It's not production-ready

It's still 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT. The API can change in incompatible ways any time. Any commit can be completely broken. You better not rely on it.

## Principles

This rest-client is based on the very same principles as the client api of JAX-RS 2.0, but a little bit easier to use. Most notably, you don't have to specify the content type you can accept; this is derived from the available MessageBodyReaders for the type you want to get.

### Build forward, link backward

It's immutable, fluent, and strictly appendable:

* Immutable: You can derive new values from old without modifying the old.
* Fluent: You can chain the parts you need to set, so the code can be read easily.
* Strictly appendable: In addition to the immutability, things set can't be taken back or overwritten. Once you've set, e.g., a query parameter, you can't remove it or even change the path any more. This restriction enforces a cleaner code style, so you don't have to look around where this or that may get set.

## Examples

For the impatient:

```
    @Data // Lombok... just for demo
    static class GithubRepository {
        String default_branch;
        String description;
    }

    RestResource t1ReposResource =
            new RestResource("https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}").with("owner", "t1");
    GithubRepository repo = t1ReposResource.with("repo", "rest-client").GET(GithubRepository.class);
```
